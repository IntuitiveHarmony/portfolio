# Jason Horst Portfolio
In this [project](https://celadon-cannoli-9eead4.netlify.app/) I wanted to recreate a personal website that I made for myself about 6 years ago when I first became interested in coding.  At the time I was trying to teach myself using tutorials and part of a Coursera course on HTML and CSS.  This course at General Assembly is the first time I've coded since then.   
## Technologies Used / Approach
My old site used CSS for all of the interactions like hovers, animations and clicks.  At the time I had no idea how to write javaScript.  My goal was to re-write this site using my newly gained knowledge.  All of the CSS was basically pulled from the old code and adjusted in minor ways as I needed. At first I started to make an individual HTML file for each page of my site (resume.html, about.html etc...) everything started to become convoluted for me so I abandoned this approach.  I have a single HTML file that contains a few divs with classes for me to attach what ever I wanted to later using javaScript functions and jQuery. I found that using this approach I was able to keep things more organized in my head and on the page. The dev tools in chrome were really useful to me in helping me to visualize where everything was and also to test and track how my jQuery was changing the HTML.  This project is contained within a Github [repository](https://github.com/IntuitiveHarmony/portfolio) and deployed using Netlify.  There is also an embedded SoundCloud player
## Unsolved Issues
Aside from random typos, scoping and traversing issues, the main issue I had and one that still persists in one way or another is getting the HTML elements to lay out how I want them to on the page.  I know that this has to do with a lot of the settings in CSS, I tried to only focus on basic positioning and styling issues so that I could focus on the functionality of the javaScript and jQuery parts.  There are also errors that come up that are associated with the embedded player. ![errors screenshot](/files/pictures/Screen Shot 2022-08-01 at 3.41.18 PM.png) When I comment this section out and test it, I did not find any errors.  I attempted to make this site responsive by starting with the mobile version first and then work outward from there.  While I was writing the media queries for this everything started to look horrible!  This is another example of one of my struggles with HTML and CSS placement.  I will continue to work on these issues by watching the videos that were suggested and experiment more.
